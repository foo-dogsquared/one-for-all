A single web program to make your own list of search engines in one neat page. A default list is included for those lazy bums to make their own list (like me üòÅ).

## List of included search engines so far:
- BitBucket
- Can I Use
- cdnjs
- DevDocs
- Dev.to
- DuckDuckGo
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Google
- LinkedIn
- MDN Web Docs
- Medium
- Noun Project
- npm Package Search
- Stack Overflow
- YouTube

...and so much more to be brought by you! That's right, you can make your own list! The possibilities are (almost) endless!

## Install
If you need to install it for some reason (I won't judge but ok), you can simply download the zip file provided by GitHub. You could also fork it and clone it in your machine, why not. 

No need for install libraries or anything &mdash; except for the devtools which is listed in `package.json`, if you want to have an easier time debugging these shiiiiiiinanigans.

## Features
### Configurable list
One of the biggest features of `one-for-all` is you can make your own list of search engine. Just head on over [here](./docs/json-search-engine-list.md) to know how does it work and what are the required valid data for it.

<!-- TODO: Write the docs of the commands -->
### Optional commands
You can do the following commands in the main `<input>` element as if you're using a CLI program. You can view the available commands over [here](./docs/available-commands.md). A GUI version (thus, user-friendly) of them will be implemented Soon‚Ñ¢.

## To-do / User stories
- ~~the user can set some keywords to be associated with their `se-list.json` URL~~
- multiple input cursor on different `<input>` in the list, similar to Visual Studio Code's multiple cursor
- update the page aesthetic
- make a GUI and mobile-friendly (and user-friendly) version of the CLI commands
